# SMS Spam Detection Project

## Background
This project develops a spam detection system for SMS messages to build foundational NLP and classification skills.

## Problem Statement
Create a binary classifier for SMS messages that:
- Accurately identifies spam vs legitimate messages
- Handles class imbalance
- Provides interpretable results

## Personal Motivation
Building on experience from text analysis projects (e.g., [Word Cloud Visualization](https://nayeonkwonds.medium.com/deep-dive-into-word-cloud-creation-c2fc7fc09c12), [Travel Blog Analysis](https://nayeonkwonds.medium.com/web-scraping-and-text-analysis-of-travel-trends-on-blogs-e83a453d34ed)) and binary classification work (e.g., [SME Closure Prediction](https://github.com/KwonNayeon/numble)), this project aims to deepen NLP expertise and classification techniques. The goal is to expand practical knowledge in text processing, model evaluation, and implementation of various classification approaches.
